# Vision System

This repo contains our implementation of the vision system. 
It includes the interface that defines what functions are necessary for any
CV implementation to work with our system. It also includes our own implementation
of the CV module calculations interfacing with our specific camera setup.

## Utils - nees update
Utils can be found in the movement_utils folder. They can be used for calibration, introduction of new commands and more. The current utils are:
1. command_sender: initiates the movement system, and then enable the user to send G-code directly to the movement_system.
2. predefined_plan: moves the movement system in a pre-built plan. Can be modified for different needs and scenarios.
3. keypress_controller: Creates a keyboard press based interface with the movement system. Useful for calibration. WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT VALIDATED YET
